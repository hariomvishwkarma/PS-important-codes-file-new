Hello, I have changed the pick up location for my website. I need all active products to be available FOR PICK UP at the location I set as, Patty Q's Jewelry The Showroom. Please transfer all active inventory available to this updated location. ASAP THANKS
===>I have updated quantity in 30% of products rest are under process.

Hello sir,

Thank you for the update. The issue remains even when I enter different city names. For example, the attached area should have Zone A rate which is 30QAR for shipping but it is still showing 50QAR which is a miscalculated number 

Zone A: 30 QAR
Lusail, The Pearl, West Bay, Al-Gharaffa, Madinat Khalifa, Al-Rayan, Al-Sadd, Muaither, Abu Hamor, Salwa Road, Airport Road, Ain Khalid, Al-Thumama.
 
Zone B: 40 QAR
Semaisma, Al-Khor, Al-Thukhaira, Um Qarn, Um Salal Ali, Um Salal Mohammed, Al-Wukair, Al-Wakra
 
Zone C: 50 QAR
Areas include: Al-Shahanya, Mukaynis, Mesaieed, Al-Jumailiya, Dukhan, Al-Ruwiais, Al-Garyah, Abu Samrah.

Let's give it one more go otherwise we will need to pause this app and try another one as it is unacceptable how such errors continue

1. I can't add it directly to my cart on my computer. I also tested it on my colleague's computer, but it didn't workeither. But on the link you sent, I can click to add to the shopping cart. Why is this?
-----It is running fine on our desktop.

2. If it shows that it is not possible on our side, it will be no problem when you test it. Is it because our theme version is different or there is an error?
-----No, there is no version problem.

Thank you
